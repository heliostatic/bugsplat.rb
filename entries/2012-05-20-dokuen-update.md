After writing [last blog post](/dokuen-a-personal-app-platform) I started to build out another app using Dokuen and the pain really got to me. I've addressed the caveats that I listed at the bottom of that article and I think Dokuen is ready for tryouts. I wouldn't put anything mission critical on it, but that's not really what it's for anyway.

--fold--

Please go [try it out](https://github.com/peterkeen/dokuen) and let me know what you think. There are still some rough edges but it's entirely usable as is.

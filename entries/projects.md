<h3 id="opensource">Open Source</h3>

I have developed various bits of open source software and <a href="https://github.com/peterkeen">released them on Github</a>. Here are a few of my more interesting projects:

* [Dokuen](https://github.com/peterkeen/dokuen), a personal PaaS for Mac and Linux
* [Capistrano::Buildpack](https://github.com/peterkeen/capistrano-buildpack), a Capistrano extension for deploying with [Heroku-style buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks)
* [Ledger Web](https://github.com/peterkeen/ledger-web), a web-based reporting system for the [Ledger](/ledger.html) command line accounting tool.

<h4 id="fivepad"><a href="http://www.fivepad.me">Fivepad</a></h4>

The easiest way to keep track of your apartment search. I build this to help my girlfriend and I search for apartments in the Portland area, but it's useful anywhere Craigslist has coverage. Using it is pretty simple. You just paste in a Craigslist URL into the Add a Place box and it scrapes the page for useful information and shows it to you on a map, along with all of your other places. Fivepad is a straightforward Rails application which is now shut down.

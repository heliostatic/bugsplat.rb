A few months ago I created a hosted document conversion service named [Docverter](http://www.docverter.com). The idea was to collect together the best document conversion tools I could find into one comprehensive service and sell access. Many of these tools are difficult to install if you're used to a service like Heroku, so it only made sense to wrap it all up.

--fold--

After two months of trying to make a go of it, I've made the decision to open source the server component of Docverter. I've put the source on [Github](https://github.com/docverter/docverter), along with installation instructions. I'm also available on a consulting basis for installation and integration work. [Email me](mailto:pete@bugsplat.info) if you're interested.

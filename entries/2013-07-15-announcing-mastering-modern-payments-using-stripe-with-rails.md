Over the past few years I've put together a [number of projects](/projects) that use [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and their [Ruby API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/ruby) to collect payments and manage subscriptions. I've learned quite a bit about how to effectively use the things that Stripe provides to my best advantage. Two months ago I decided that I would like to share that knowledge and so I started working on a guide to integrating Stripe with Rails and today I'd like to announce that <a href="/mastering-modern-payments"><em>Mastering Modern Payments: Using Stripe with Rails</em></a> will be available on <strong>August 15th, 2013</strong>.

--fold--

<em>Mastering Modern Payments</em> covers the gamut of Stripe integrations, from the simplest using `checkout.js` all the way through custom payment forms, subscriptions, background workers and more. It's my first ebook and I couldn't be more excited.

My intended audience is Ruby developers who know Rails well but need some help with their first Stripe integration or want help figuring out how to make their existing integration better. If that's you, you should <a href="/mastering-modern-payments">sign up for the mailing list</a> to get updates and announcements leading up to launch day as well as a 10% off coupon code and a free chapter named <em><strong>State and History</strong></em> which covers how to easily keep an audit trail on your sales records.

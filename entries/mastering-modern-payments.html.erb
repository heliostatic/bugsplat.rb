  Every time you have to write another Stripe integration you drag your heels. It's frustrating. There are lots of moving pieces and no one place to see a complete implementation. How do you work with webhooks? Where should you set up subscription plans? What's the best way to make sure your customers aren't left hanging if Stripe falls over?
</p>

<p>
  Tutorials only get you so far, though. Soon, you're looking at blog posts from years ago and wondering if they're still correct. API documentation doesn't help if you don't know what you're looking for. GitHub has lots of payment gems, but how do you know if they're any good?
</p>

<p>
What if you could read a story and follow along with a complete production application? What if you knew for certain that you're reading the most up-to-date best practices?
</p>

<h2>What if you could get paid sooner and more reliably?</h2>

<p>
Over the last two years I've written Stripe integrations in half a dozen Rails applications and worked with more for consulting clients. Like you, I've combed through the docs and the blog posts and the GitHub repositories looking for answers and come up short.

    Mastering Modern Payments was like a pool of <strong>cool refreshing water</strong> after I'd been traveling in the desert of obscurity for weeks. Unlike the API docs, or most blog posts I found on the topic, Pete thought this through three steps ahead of solving the problems I'd be having a few weeks or months after deployment. This will end up <strong>saving me an immeasurable amount of time and money</strong>.

      I'm fairly new to Rails and setting up billing had me flustered for weeks. I was stuck, spinning my wheels, not knowing what was the best route to take. Pete's book is a guiding light of common sense and practical application. Now I can setup billing with confidence, and more importantly, <strong>ship my product</strong>.

Stripe is a popular credit card processor available in countries world-wide. If you're looking to take credit cards, bitcoin, or Alipay (in China) then you should absolutely look at Stripe.

I've written quite extensively about how to use Stripe with Ruby on Rails applications, including a smattering of articles (see below), a book named [Mastering Modern Payments: Using Stripe with Rails](https://www.masteringmodernpayments.com), and Payola, an open source Rails engine that provides a common-sense, asynchronous approach to integrating Stripe.

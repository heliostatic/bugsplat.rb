Pete is the most hirable Rails developer I know at the moment. So well rounded and brilliant with systems and networking stuff too. Among our bootstrapper collective, I think he is the one who most consistently has the answer for something tricky or technical.

<blockquote>Pete's help was instrumental in getting Docverter up and running to auto-generate PDF gift certificates.  We were able to smoothly sell and instantly deliver via email over $100,000 in GCs during our holiday season.

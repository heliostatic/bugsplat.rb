For the past three years this blog has has featured the same basic design. Header, sidebar, content, footer. Simple, classic, kind of ... homely. Today I decided to give a new design a whirl, and if you're reading this on the website you can see what's changed.

Essentially I've removed the sidebar in favor of a clean header and footer. I've also condensed several pages onto a comprehensive [About](/about) page. The colors are basically the same, although I've brightened up the background a bit. The biggest change by far has been switching from some random two-column css layout I found somewhere on the internet to a design based on [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap). I used a tool called [Bootstrap ThemeRoller](http://www.bootstrapthemeroller.com) to customize the colors and fonts and then made a few remarkably small changes to the markup and here we are.

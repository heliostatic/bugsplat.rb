<h1 class="book big center">Stripe Checkup</h1>

<h2 class="book big center">A monthly checkup for the most <br> important part of your business</h2>

What happens when you finish the payment integration in your application? You *make sure it keeps working*. Introducing **Stripe Checkup**, a monthly service that watches your Rails payment integration so you never have to worry about it.

## Payment failures are expensive; Regular maintenance is cheap

Keeping your Stripe system up to date with the latest API changes can be a daunting task. Stripe moves fast and sometimes a new feature comes along that would benefit your business, but you never have the time to get it installed. Sometimes the Rails security team releases an urgent patch, but you're in Tahiti and can't apply it right away. Once a year your SSL certificates need to be rolled over. Are you on top of that?

Small, regular, cheap updates to your application will keep it humming along without the huge expense of big-bang upgrades every few years. Stripe Checkup is designed with that in mind.

**There are only five Stripe Checkup slots available**, so if this sounds interesting keep reading. There's a link to the application form toward the bottom.

## Who this is for

Stripe Checkup is not for every business, but you might want to [apply](/checkup-apply) if any of these things sound like you:

* You're a small to mid-sized business that uses Stripe and Rails
* You have subscription customers bringing in revenue but don't have an in-house staff to keep up with security updates and Stripe's API changes.
* You never want to worry about your Stripe integration again.

## What you get

* A free (up to $249/month retail) account at [Baremetrics](https://www.baremetrics.io/) for your Stripe-based SaaS application
* A yearly SSL certificate renewal and installation
* Patches to apply for Rails security updates
* A monthly security scan of your application's source, looking for common security vulnerabilities
* A monthly black-box security scan of your production application, looking for XSS and sql injection vulnerabilities
* A monthly report with the latest set of Stripe changes and how they can improve your business, as well as patches that you optionally apply to implement them

## Who are you?

I'm [Pete Keen](https://www.petekeen.net), a software developer and Stripe enthusiast from Ann Arbor, Michigan. I wrote a book named [Mastering Modern Payments: Using Stripe with Rails](https://www.petekeen.net/mastering-modern-payments).

## How much is this?

Glad you asked! Stripe Checkup costs **$1,500 per month or $15,000 per year (a 17% discount)**. In order to be most effective, a minimum of three months is required for any project. If you decide to pay monthly, you'll pay for the first three months up front, and then per-month after.

I'll spend a day every month analyizing your Baremetrics reports and getting to know your application and how Stripe's ever-evolving API can continue to help your business grow, as well as meeting with you to talk through any questions and implement any application-level changes required. I'll also keep your application up to date with Rails security updates and run two forms of vulnerability detection: a source code level scan as well as a black box scan. Once a year I'll roll your SSL certificate for you as well.

If your application is hit with a security exploit, you could lose tens of thousands of dollars, your ability to charge credit cards, or even your entire business. You'll be spending far less for Stripe Checkup.

If you're ever unhappy with Stripe Checkup **I'll provide a full refund**. I stand behind my work and stake my business on making you happy and secure.
